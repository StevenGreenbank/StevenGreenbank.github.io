Obfuscape was a large expansion on a game idea I had attempted before, a gameplay loop consisting of rapid-fire prompts where the player had to answer basic math problems incorrectly in rapid succession, unless certain conditions were met that they had to suddenly answer the question correctly instead. In the original version, called RunaScape, the player would be required to answer the math question incorrectly unless the answer contained a "7" in it, as "7" was a lucky number.

You can see videos logging the development of that game in the [early](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhWS9QfBg0J/)  [stages](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhcCmsZFduo/) and the [finished product](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhqYl3qFg2A/)

I had always wanted to expand even further on this game, in essence Obfuscape is a spiritual successor to RunaScape, though with a drastically different art direction and narrative tone. Now, instead of trying to purposefully fail a mad-minute style math quiz, hoping to get detention so that you can avoid your aunt's horrific experimental baked goods, you are actively attempting to thwart campaigns that do harm to a far greater number of people. 

Done away with the "lucky number" conceit, I was able to adapt the intuition-challenging mechanics of having to answer incorrectly in one instance and correctly in the next to a far greater number of puzzles, as the need to answer either correctly or incorrectly was communicated to the player along with the question. 

The first, and admittedly only (in the current version) expansion was rock-paper-scissors prompts, where the player needs to answer which symbol would either lose or win against the given one. I hope to add more types of games as I further learn the ins-and-outs of the godot engine.
